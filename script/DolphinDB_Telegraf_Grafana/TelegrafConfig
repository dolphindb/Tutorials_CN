interval = "10s"
## Rounds collection interval to 'interval'
## ie, if interval="10s" then always collect on :00, :10, :20, etc.

## Telegraf will send metrics to outputs in batches of at most
## metric_batch_size metrics.
## This controls the size of writes that Telegraf sends to output plugins.
metric_batch_size = 1000

## Maximum number of unwritten metrics per output.  Increasing this value
## allows for longer periods of output downtime without dropping metrics at the
## cost of higher maximum memory usage.
metric_buffer_limit = 10000

## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.
## Each plugin will sleep for a random time within jitter before collecting.
## This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the
## same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
collection_jitter = "0s"

## Collection offset is used to shift the collection by the given amount.
## This can be be used to avoid many plugins querying constraint devices
## at the same time by manually scheduling them in time.
# collection_offset = "0s"

## Default flushing interval for all outputs. Maximum flush_interval will be
## flush_interval + flush_jitter
flush_interval = "10s"
## Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid
## large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
## ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
flush_jitter = "0s"

## Collected metrics are rounded to the precision specified. Precision is
## specified as an interval with an integer + unit (e.g. 0s, 10ms, 2us, 4s).
## Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s".
##
## By default or when set to "0s", precision will be set to the same
## timestamp order as the collection interval, with the maximum being 1s:
##   ie, when interval = "10s", precision will be "1s"
##       when interval = "250ms", precision will be "1ms"
##
## Precision will NOT be used for service inputs. It is up to each individual
## service input to set the timestamp at the appropriate precision.
precision = "0s"

## Override default hostname, if empty use os.Hostname()
hostname = ""
## If set to true, do no set the "host" tag in the telegraf agent.
